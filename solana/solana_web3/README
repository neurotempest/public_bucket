Staking SOL in Devnet 

A NodeJS script that stakes Solana in Devnet, based on the official Solana doc at https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/javascript-reference


To stake on Solana, three wallets (address) are required. 
A wallet for funding, a authorisation wallet, and the staking wallet. 
If these wallets already exists, the script will load them, and prompt for
airdrop funding if funding wallet has no SOL stored. 
After, it will create the staking account in SOL blockchain, if it does not exist, 
and will try to delegate the staked amount to the firstf validator in the validator list.
